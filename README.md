# 📊 Dynamic Data Chart Project

This project enables users to dynamically add and display data on a chart, with the ability to input as many values as desired. Built with **JavaScript** and the **Chart.js Library**, the application provides an intuitive and engaging interface for data visualization.

Users can switch between five different chart types to best suit their preferences: **bar**, **line**, **pie**, **radar**, and **doughnut**. The project also features **responsive design**, ensuring that charts adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

Additionally, users can interact with the charts in multiple ways:

- **Remove data points** directly by clicking on them.
- **Hover over data points** to view detailed insights and analyses, such as exact values and proportions.

This project showcases the flexibility and functionality of dynamic data visualization, making it a powerful tool for displaying and analyzing information interactively.
